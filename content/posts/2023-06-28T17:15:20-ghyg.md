I'm currently paging through my old github repos, looking for inspiration in old excitements, but I face a conundrum. I am inclined to delete smaller & older projects. I feel that some no longer represent my skills, interests, nor authentic identity. It's cluttered and unfamiliar. At the same time, I have also come to feel that as much historical data should be saved as can be done so efficiently and accessibly. 
  There is also the question of identity & relation. Many of these projects bear my deadname, and were collaborative efforts with former classmates & colleagues. I want to hold space for personal data autonomy, especially as regards gender transition, while also wanting to honor where I've been and those collaborators have helped shape my journey.
  The best strategy I can think to employ is to archive independent projects that don't feel aligned with my current professional trajectory, more explicitly address my name change at the top level of my profile, and apply meaningful updates to the projects that I do want to highlight so they are featured in recent history. I shall mostly let collaborative projects be. If I do encounter ones I want to archive or revisit, I will try to reconnect with those collaborators! Digital hygiene is seriously nuanced work, whew.
