Still working on getting this neofeed deployed, this is my first time working with Github Actions so that has been a learning curve. The published actions that were composed into the deploy workflow for this template were erroring, so I've been trying to fix configs and reverse engineer the steps that continue failing.

OK! I got it by detailing my own Hugo install and build, and updating the usage of bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities to published @v1 instead of a personal branch
