i'm reflecting on mid august afternoon that summer has often held challenging times for me. today i hold that with gratitude for lessons learned through independent recreation. im grateful and proud that amidst turbulent days of extensive executive dysfunction (summer heat and smells cue most intense of sensory overwhelm), i gifted myself a few weeks of being more intentionally on vacation mode, and not striving for productive time spent at the screens. finding balance between rest and work remains challenging for me, and as I find myself in full-fledged despair with my current situation it is especially hard to do proper resting. So I let off the gas, explored some state parks that were all <1hr drive away, played some video games, read books in bed and hammocks, rode my bike more, grieved a tremendous loss. I am feeling rejuvenated and stronger for it. For me, rest takes work, and this period has served as an invaluable reminder of what I am capable of and what I am working for.
