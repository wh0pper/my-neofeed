Hi again! I haven't been very consistent with my development work lately as I continue trying to establish myself in a new city. I have been reading some research-backed DevOps strategy which is inspiring my efforts and affirming some core challenges I have faced in my software journey thus far. 

Today I'm getting back to resuscitating my portfolio site. Going for simple and sweet straightforward html site because I have previously gotten bogged down in tooling with that project and I'm not as motivated to invest time in it's development, it should be a showcase not another side-project.
