 It's March 24th. My last entry was January 22nd. I haven't found much motivation for computer-based work of any kind since then, it's been a challenge to even do digital coordination of establishing services after moving. The main areas I have been able to find my motives are novel forms of movement, a bit of music, and a lot of distraction. I think this is a call from my body to find some physically-based work for the now, and to accept the ongoing disability to work from any self-sanctioned desks.

 I do keep a narrow thread of dev work and technological thinking ongoing. Within it I am currently envisioning some connected & animated lighting in my new home. I am also having a bit of fun making sure I know all the latest and greatest in React tooling by making a parody clone of the wordle puzzle of the NYT. 
 
 I believe I will have a lot more capacity to apply myself in technical pursuits once I have found a self-sustaining and healthily embodied form of physical labor for myself in this everchanging world I inhabit.
