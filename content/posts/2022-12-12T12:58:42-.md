Hi, returning to my neofeed! Maybe I like the name so much because it hearkens to neopets, one of my first online experiences. I am trying out a yaml config format for variety, as compared to the template and example's toml. I believe toml is more common with go? but I've seen yaml more in my own dev work such as with terraform.
